# Resourcemod
ResourceMod is an ecosystem of plugins and other game content in Counter Strike 2. With this mod you can improve your game server with modifications (plugins) written in Javascript.

The main unique feature of ResourceMod is its own Javascript runtime on v8, which allows you to natively run Javascript code inside your game server.

We use the SourceHooks library, which allows you to natively communicate with the game engine by proxying eventing to the Javascript engine. At this point I would like to thank the AlliedModders community, who have really helped and continue to help with the development of ResourceMod. They are right now continuing to rebuild the SDK to allow the use of the Source engine features. If you know anything about reverse engineering, please help them out.

(Runs on v8 btw)
